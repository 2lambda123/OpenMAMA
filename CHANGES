                                OpenMAMA 2.1.1.2

This release contains very minor fixes focusing on the build environment. The
2.1.1.1 release, which introduced OpenMAMDA in addition to C++ and Java support,
complicated the build environment significantly. These changes address some of
the build issues encountered. Subsequent minor releases will attempt to further
simplify the build process.

Changes:

Add patch for -lmama for news and orderbook examples

  The news and orderbook examples were not building because the linker could
  not find libmama. This patch adjusts the link flags to include the path to
  the mama c libraries.

Add libpthread to library list for sem_timedwait

  configure.ac needs to search for sem_timedwait in both librt and libpthread. 
  On OS's like certain Solaris versions that do not support sem_timedwait(), 
  OpenMAMA provides an implentation.

Updated Build Instructions

  Added better download and build instructions for the Avis client and router.

  For the OpenMAMA build it is necessary to specify --with-avis to build the
  Avis bridge, and it is also necessary to invoke generateBuildFiles.sh prior
  to building source from a cloned git repository.

[mama] Adding .gitignore

  This patch introduces a .gitignore file to force git to skip known build
  artifacts when displaying status information.
